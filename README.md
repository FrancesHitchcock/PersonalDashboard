# Personal Dashboard Suggested Exercise - Scrimba Module 9: Working with APIs 

## About The Project

The personal dashboard was created as a development of the shared capstone project which was used to demonstrate and practise Promise rejection. It is designed as a Chrome extension.  This exercise was used as an opportunity to explore additional APIs including:

- UK Bank Holidays JSON file https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json 
- Joke API https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/
- Currency API https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api#readme

### Bank Holidays
The user can select the year for which they want to display the planned bank holidays.

### Joke
A random single-line, safe-mode (not offensive) joke is displayed from the joke API

### Currency
The current exchange rate value is displayed for a number of currencies, against one pound sterling. The arrow next to each currency indicates whether the value of the pound has increased, decreased or remained the same compared to the previous week's value.

The project also includes formatting of dates and times.

The throw Error() method and the .catch() method were used for error handling in promises.
